-Run the Server first.The IP address of the Server is assumed to be your local machine and the port number is pre-defined as 6700.

-Once the Server is running, run a client and give the client a name when asked to. The client then enters the room and can broadcast messages.

-Create as many clients as needed.

Note: A client upon exiting crashes the server because the server tries to read from it or broadcast to it even though it is gone.
